//! Built-in zero-downtime backups.
//!
//! Bichon owns every byte of its data on local disk (Tantivy indices, the
//! bichon-blob content store, and the memdb snapshot/WAL). Backups are
//! **two-phase** (design doc §5): a short capture window produces immutable
//! artifacts, then a content-addressed upload to S3 persists them without
//! touching the write gate:
//!
//! 1. **Preflight** — [`backend::BackupBackend::preflight`] verifies the S3
//!    target before anything is paused.
//! 2. **Capture** — [`gate::WRITE_GATE`] is paused, every in-flight write
//!    drains, and each registered contributor
//!    ([`prepare::BackupPreparer`]) delivers its exact products as
//!    [`artifact::Artifact`]s. The gate reopens the moment capture finishes,
//!    so the server keeps receiving mail for the whole upload.
//! 3. **Upload** — [`backend::BackupBackend::upload`] content-addresses the
//!    artifacts (object key = sha256), commits a restore-point manifest and
//!    applies retention — all with the gate open ([`engine`]).
//! 4. **Finalize** — the window is closed unconditionally, even on failure or
//!    panic ([`manager`]).
//!
//! The community edition registers four preparers (memdb, blob, envelope
//! index, attachment index) via [`prepare::register_base_preparers`]; Pro and
//! enterprise editions append their own via [`prepare::register_preparer`].
//!
//! [`init`] wires everything up (preparers + scheduler) and is called from
//! the shared `BichonContext::initialize()` hook.
