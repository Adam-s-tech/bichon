//! Artifacts: the unit of delivery from storage contributors to a backup run.

//! a whole-tree copier to pick up, each contributor *delivers* its exact
//! products as
//! [`Artifact`]s. The manager collects them and hands them to the engine,
//! which content-addresses each (object key = sha256) and records the
//! logical → object mapping in the manifest.
